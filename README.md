# Dynamic A/B Testing for Banner Optimization
Many times business problems are more dynamic than what a single A/B test can solve. In this project, we use a banner showing case to demonstrate how business operations can potentially benefit from continous A/B testing and dynamic strategy choosing.

This project is a group work of MSBA students at University of Minnesota: [Xinbo Wang](https://github.com/xinbo-w), [Brandon Park](https://github.com/brandon-park), [Sricharan Sridhar](https://github.com/sricharans), [Phuong Tran](https://github.com/phuongdtrn), and [Vivian Ho](https://github.com/chiayenho).

## Results
Our method achieves 92% of the perfect scenario, comparing to 83% and 84% of the traditional A/B and show half and half.
